# colony.bsp
A very basic and generic interface definition for micro-controller based BSPs (Board Support Packages).  This Package/Repository defines the 'abstract' BSP interfaces/paradigm for the Colony.Core C++ Class library.

The Colony.Bsp package follows all of the same requirements, conventions, design patterns, etc. as defined by the Colony.Core package (www.integerfox.com/colony.core)

Documentation is located in the top/ directory and/or available at: www.integerfox.com/colony.bsp

To build/use Colony.Bsp within the Outcast model - see the installation instruction at: www.integerfox.com/outcast/start_here.html#Installing

The code within Colony.Bsp repository has the same BSD type of licensing agreement as Colony.Core (see the top/ directory).
